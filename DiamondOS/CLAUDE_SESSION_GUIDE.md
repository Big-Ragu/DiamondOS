# ü§ñ CLAUDE SESSION QUICK START GUIDE

## üéØ FOR FUTURE CLAUDE SESSIONS

### üìÅ **IMMEDIATE SETUP (First 30 seconds of each session):**

1. **Check project location:**
```
Filesystem:directory_tree path="E:\DiamondOS"
```

2. **Read current plan:**
```  
Filesystem:read_file path="E:\DiamondOS\SESSION_PLAN.md"
```

3. **Check what was last completed:**
- Look for completed checkboxes in SESSION_PLAN.md
- Read any recent files to understand current state

---

## üöÄ **SERVER INSTRUCTIONS (USER REQUEST):**

**IMPORTANT:** After each session where you create/update code:
1. **Notify user when code is ready for browser testing**
2. **Tell user to run these commands in E:\DiamondOS:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Let them know when server should be ready at http://localhost:3000**

**NOTE:** Claude cannot actually run servers or execute commands - only create/modify files. User must run the commands themselves.

## ‚è±Ô∏è **10-15 MINUTE SESSION RULES:**

1. **Focus on ONE clear deliverable per session**
2. **Save ALL work before session ends**
3. **Update progress checkboxes in SESSION_PLAN.md**
4. **Leave clear notes for next session**
5. **NOTIFY USER when code is ready for browser testing**

## üí° **KEY REMINDERS:**

- **Claude can't remember previous sessions** - always read existing files first
- **Claude can't run servers** - only create/modify files, user must run commands
- **Build incrementally** - each session should add working features
- **Save frequently** - use Filesystem:write_file for all code
- **Update the plan** - mark completed tasks and note any changes
- **Be specific** - each session should have measurable outcomes
- **Always notify user when ready for browser testing**
