3. Replace with your actual User ID
4. Save file

### Step 3: Run Complete Setup (30 seconds)
1. In Supabase **SQL Editor**
2. Copy **ALL** content from `complete_setup.sql` 
3. Paste and click **"Run"**
4. ✅ Should see: "Setup complete! 6 teams and 15 players created"

## 🎯 RESULT:
Your app will now load with:
- **6 Teams:** NY Pinstripes, Boston Green Monsters, Houston Space Cowboys, etc.
